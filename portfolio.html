            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Steven Peng. I was studying to become an engineer, but life's path led me to studying
                web development at George Washington University's coding bootcamp. Aside from what I do career wise, 
                some of what I love to do are playing basketball, table tennis, and going swimming.
